wim.py requires an xml config file - see example
this details 3 types of triggers which are translated into UDP packets
trigger types: gps scalar, gps index, bluetooth

GPS TRIGGERS require a serial gps device sending NMEA sentences
the gps device address is in the xml config file

gps scalar and index triggers reference geo-located bitmap overlays
index triggers send a pre-deteremined message when an area is entered
scalar triggers send a continually varying signal by interpolating greyscale values

BLUETOOTH TRIGGERS are similar to index triggers but send a message when a
known bluetooth device is encountered

execute wim.py invoking a configfile to begin i.e.

./wim.py gentconfig.xml

open testwimpy.pd in pure data to see the results (if you don't have gps use wimpyGUI to test)

=================================================================

wim.py includes wimpyGUI - a system for simulating gps input during development.

wimpyGUI is a processing program - http://processing.org

wimpyGUI uses the same bitmaps and overlays as wim.py - copy them into the data folder

wimpyGUI requires the hypermiedia.net UDP library from here: http://ubaa.net/shared/processing/udp/

to use- open wimpyGUI.pde with processing
press 0,1 or 2 to switch between bitmap overlays
move the mouse to simulate gps input
